			<h1>Walter H. Roman</h1>
			<h2>Some call me "Walt". About three people call me "Wally".  My family calls me "Waltercito". Most people, though, just call me "Walter".</h2>
			<h2>I'm an aspiring musician, aspiring front-end developer and aspiring human. I love coffee. I love music. I love designing. I love hiking. I love meeting people. No, seriously. Do you remember that guy at the coffee shop earlier today that struck up a conversation with you about nothing? Yes, that was me. Well, probably not... but you get my point.</h2>
